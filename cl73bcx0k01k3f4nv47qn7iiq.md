## Why I Wanted to be a Developer: My Story

# Introduction

Greetings everyone and welcome to a new blog! I'm writing this one as a part of Hashnode's #4articles4weeks challenge. Today I'm gonna be talking about how and why I decided to become a developer. My story stems from a very dark place but at the time of writing this blog, it's shooting for the sky!

# Prelude

I have always been interested in computers and software. Back in 7th grade, I used to play games, edit photos and videos, make presentations and participate in inter-school competitions using those skills. As evident, I wasn't really much into programming. I was... quite average at it actually. But, I gradually had to put everything on pause as I entered 11th standard as I had to prepare for my college entrance exams. In those two years, I realized something. Something that made me decide that I wanted to a developer.

# Pivot!

My exams did not go well at all and I basically ended up wasting 2 of my years on nothing. However, that is the time when I had a real talk with myself and I asked:
> What do you want to do in your career? What are you good at? Are you good enough to make sure you stand out and make it an economically viable option? 


The answer: there was nothing that satisfied all the three criteria! THAT point is when I knew that I had to pick a niche and start grinding. My sister, who is 5 years elder to me, was pursuing her B-Tech degree at that time and I had seen her preparing for interviews. It was already decided that I will also be pursuing a B-Tech degree. So, I decided that I will become a developer. It aligned with my education and interested me as well. 

# ..And So it Began

I began my first semester of college. My branch is : Computer Science and Engineering with Specialization in Blockchain Technology. I picked blockchain as it was something that fascinated me and I knew that it was going to explode. In my first semester however, I didn't do much in that area. I took guidance from my sister and her network and started my developer journey. I was told to learn C++ and so that's what I did. I had studied Python for school work in 11th and 12th and I was well versed with it. In my first semester, I used to solve tough problems in Python and helped my classmates. I was still not sure which subdomain I should go with as there were (and still are) multiple tech stacks and roles available. At the start of the second semester, there were club recruitments going on in my college and I wasn't getting picked in any of them. I started applying for more roles, hoping to join at least 1 club. I saw a club recruiting in the blockchain domain and I decided to revisit my abandoned interest. I qualified the first round of their screening and was told when they would be holding the next round. I then started preparing for it by looking into what was going on in the blockchain space at that time. That completely rejuvenated my interest and I decided that I wanted to go all in on Web3. So that's what I did!

# Current State of Affairs

I am now well versed with core blockchain concepts and have built some dApps too. However, I've currently paused web3 development and I'm currently learning React to strengthen my frontend skills. I will then move on to NextJS and then dive deep into the web3 stack. I am committed to become a good developer and become **financially independent**. I want to reach that point where I would only do college studies for the sake getting a degree, not for getting a decent GPA. I want to build dope stuff and be known as the coolest person in the web3 development space. I want to travel to places. I want to meet new people and get to know them. I've seen my sister succeed as a developer and I hope that I will too.

# Thank You!

Thank you so much for reading this blog to the end! I hope you enjoyed! I am expanding my technical skillset right now so I won't be writing too many blogs. I am building stuff and might write about one of my projects in week 3. See you then! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

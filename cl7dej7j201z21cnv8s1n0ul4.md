## Why I Love Huddle01: A Decentralized Video Meeting Platform

# Introduction
> "I'm gonna build a fully decentralized application. There is going to be no centralization at all! My fellow co-founders, let's meet on.... **Zoom** " 

Sounds kinda ironic doesn't it? Decentralization maxis using centralized platforms to bring their ideas to life? Well, it all changes now!

# What is Huddle01?

They tried to go with the name "Huddle" first but the domain was already taken so they had to change it up a bit. Not the first time that is happening to someone lol. Huddle01 is widely accepted as the decentralized version of Zoom. However, there's a lot more to it than that. They are trying to fix the scalability problem of WebRTC and are also adding a whole lot of value to the Web3 ecosystem. 

# The Team

This is what I like the most about Huddle01. Their 22 member team is comprised mostly of Gen-Z folks, around 20-22 years of age. Their youngest member, Preetham, who is their community manager is only 16 years old. Everybody in the team is trying to bring about change to the web3 world. Pack a bunch of zealous and talented Gen-Z web3 enthusiasts in a room and ask them to build something cool. What do you get? Huddle01. One of their founders, Vaibhav, actually quit for some time in the initial stages because of the large amount of workload and became a bartender. Later, he was convinced by Ayush, another founder, to rejoin them. I think looking back at that phase now, Vaibhav must be quite proud of where he is at this time, like he should be! Their workplace environment is very friendly and sportsmanship is a part of their culture.

# What They Do

Many people believe that NFTs are an amazing *in theory* but don't really have any utility  ie. they can't be used anywhere. Huddle01 has made strides in the Web3 world by actually making NFTs useful. You can keep an NFT as your Avatar in Huddle01 meets! You can also use your [ENS domain]("https://ens.domains/") or your [lens handle]("https://lens.xyz/") as your username. Huddle01 allows us to record meetings and store them on IPFS (decentralized storage). One can also livestream their meetings using LivePeer. They have partnered with many organizations such as Messari, LearnWeb3DAO, MetaPass. Apart from this, Huddle01 is also trying to make a better version of WebRTC by increasing its scalability. Their early stage dApp, AudioX, allows to users with crypto wallets to communicate using WebRTC. In [their blog]("https://blog.huddle01.com/audiox-future-of-internet-calling-bf17af1ff5e1") about this project, they have described it as the WhatsApp of Web3.

# How It Inspires Me 
Huddle01's constant effort to add value to the web3 ecosystem and build something meaningful for the community is remarkable. Their cool, energetic, talented, friendly and open-to-feedback team is all one could ask for, both as a user and as an employee. They have done everything right so far and I hope they'll continue doing so in the future as well! 

# Thank You!
